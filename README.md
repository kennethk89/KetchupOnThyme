Ketchup on Thyme is a data-centric, web application that provide users with live data on
the occupancy of a restaurant at any given time. To make this work, customers and
restaurants would have to be using the same application and the app’s data would be
created and updated on the fly by the restaurant's host as customers enter or leave the restaurant.

## Problem

Imagine being out downtown on a Friday night in a group of 7 looking for a place to hang
out, any place. I’ve been there - risky. Now imagine knowing beforehand that there are 3
places within a 400m walking radius that are able to host your group if you turn up in
the next 15 minutes. Ketchup on Thyme recognizes that your thyme is important, the
more you walk around, frustrations increases, hope shimmers away, the less you
ketchup.

# KETCHUP ON THYME 

This project was submitted as my final project after a 10 weeks web-development bootcamp at BrainStation Vancouver.

Ketchup on Thyme uses the MVC model that shows two different views and controllers depending on whether you're a user or restaurant staff, these two views essentially takes data from the same database. The app aims to provide users with live data on restaurants' seating occupancy based on a search input by the users - at the same time, seating capacity is being created and updated by hosts of the respective restaurants.

## Problem

Imagine being out downtown on a Friday night in a group of 7 looking for a place to hang
out, any place. Iâ€™ve been there - risky. Now imagine knowing beforehand that there are 3
places within a 400m walking radius that are able to host your group if you turn up in
the next 15 minutes. Ketchup on Thyme recognizes that your thyme is important, the
more you walk around, frustrations increases, hope shimmers away, the less you
ketchup.

## Tech Stack and APIs
